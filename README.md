TouchOSC-Bitwig
===============

Mappings and Script for Touch OSC and Bitwig
This is a Work in Progress ;-)

I can´t figure out the correct Naming of the Bridge. Bitwig won´t recognize it for now. UUID is set correctly.
Implemented as of Now: Transport Control (working)

Mappings in Touch OSC: 
Page 1: 
Buttons for Restart, Stop, Play, Record, Overdub (all Working with the Modification made to Thomas´original Script, included in the Dropbox Folder. Same code on Github)
Volume Faders: CCs 101-108
Masterfader: CC 109
Encoders (Pan): CCs 91-98
(All not Scripted yet)

Page 2: 
Encoders for Primary Device/UserControls: CCs 20-27 (Not Scripted yet)

Page 3:
4 X/Y Pads with CCs 12-19 mapped, starting with the top left Pad
